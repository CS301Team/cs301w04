Fuel Consumption Tracking Application
This application allows a user to track their fuel consumption through their entries.
It uses SQLite and two activities.

The application will crash if a number is not entered into any one
of the fuel amount, fuel unit cost, fuel cost or trip distance text boxes.

The Notepad Tutorial on the Android Developer website
was referenced in the making of this application.
